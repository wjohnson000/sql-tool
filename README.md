sql-tool
========

Simple SQL query tool that supports any database/datastore backed by a JDBC-compliant driver.
Features include:
  -- JDBC connection definition editor
  -- Favorite query editor
  -- Context-sensitive high-lighting
  -- DB browser (tables, views, functions or procedures, etc) for specific databases
  -- Query logging
  -- Results in tabular form, with easy sort-by-column

It is NOT intended to be an example of good or great Java architecture and/or design.  It is
a project that has grown in fits and starts, but ended up being pretty darn usable.
